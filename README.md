Arun Kumar

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, structuring, analyzing, and visualizing the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset.
The dataset was processed using SQL for data cleaning and Python for data visualization to extract meaningful insights.

## 🗂 Dataset Information
- Source: Kaggle – Netflix Movies and TV Shows
- Format: CSV
- Records: ~8,800
- Attributes: Movies, TV Shows, Country, Release Year, Rating, Duration, Genre, Description

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. Downloaded the Netflix dataset from Kaggle
2. Extracted ZIP file and converted it into CSV
3. Imported dataset into MySQL
4. Cleaned data using SQL queries
5. Handled missing values and validated data integrity
6. Performed SQL analysis queries
7. Connected MySQL with Python
8. Created visualizations using Python libraries

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Tasks (SQL)
- Verified duplicate records using GROUP BY and HAVING
- Handled NULL values in director and country columns
- Converted show_id to appropriate data type
- Added Primary Key constraint
- Ensured data consistency

## 📈 Data Analysis & Visualization
